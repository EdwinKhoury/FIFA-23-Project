Here, only the top 20 players are considered when computing the average overall rating of the team. FC Barcelona which was outside the top 5 in the table above is now in it. FC Bayern Munchen that was in the top 5 in the table above is not in it. This can be explained by the selection of the top 20 players of each team and not the whole squad. Here, Liverpool has the highest average overall rating (85)
As for the average potential rating, it is Real Madrid FC that tops the table with a rating of 87.81.

Unexpectedly, Libya is the Nation with the best average overall rating of 73.33. This is because only 3 players are taken into consideration. Brazil completes the top 3 with an average of 71.6.
Good teams such as Spain, England, and France are very low in the ranking since they have a lot of players. England has 1632 players with an average rating of 64. It does not reflect the ranking of the team
